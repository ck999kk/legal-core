## 🚀 Quick Start

### Complete Intelligence Analysis
```bash
./legal_study intelligence  # Master intelligence analysis
./legal_study narrative     # Story reconstruction & psychology
./legal_study forensic      # Forensic metadata extraction
```

### Gmail Evidence Analysis
```bash
./legal_study export        # Export Gmail data
./legal_study gmail         # Analyze Gmail evidence
```

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
./legal_study monitor       # Start case monitoring
./legal_study verify        # Government verification
```

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 📧 Complete Gmail Analysis
- **100% metadata extraction** from ck.chawakorn@gmail.com
- **Behavioral pattern recognition** for negotiation leverage
- **Government preference analysis** for strategic advantage
- **Fact-based analysis** preventing human error

### 🧠 Narrative Intelligence
- **Complete story reconstruction** from fragmented communications
- **Emotional intelligence analysis** of all parties
- **Relationship network mapping** showing power dynamics
- **Timeline correlation** across all data sources

### 🔬 Forensic Analysis
- **Complete metadata extraction** from .eml files
- **Legal clause detection** (Section 86, 91ZZL, etc.)
- **Behavioral analysis** and retaliation patterns
- **Authentication validation** and integrity verification

### 🏛️ Government Integration
- **Mandatory verification** using gov.au APIs
- **AustLII case law verification**
- **Legislative reference checking**
- **Academic integrity enforcement**

## 📊 System Features

### Zero Human Error Prevention
