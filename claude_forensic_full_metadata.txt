Please perform a full metadata extraction and forensic narrative mapping from the Gmail evidence set related to the tenancy dispute.

This request is made in the context of legal education and evidence analysis. Please operate with forensic integrity and provide an output suitable for use in case file preparation, not courtroom argument.

Key objectives:
1. Extract all metadata from .eml headers and attachments (date, time, sender, recipient, message-id, authentication results, etc.)
2. Identify any legal notice patterns (Section 86, 91ZZL, etc.), actor roles, timelines, and digital signatures.
3. Reconstruct a forensic timeline without assuming guilt or bias.
4. Map logical contradictions, delay patterns, or retaliation indicators based strictly on timestamped evidence.
5. Preserve full neutrality. Do not side with tenant or agency. Let facts and metadata speak for themselves.
