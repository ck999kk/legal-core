## Practical Case Study Methodology

### Phase 1: Case Acquisition and Preparation
```bash
# Legal Research Automation
./legal research "case_name OR citation"
./legal analyze "legal_issue"
./legal extract "judgment_file.pdf"
```

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Case Analysis

1. **Primary Legal Questions**: What law applies?
2. **Procedural Issues**: Jurisdiction, standing, time limits
3. **Factual Disputes**: Evidence evaluation, witness credibility
4. **Policy Considerations**: Social, economic, constitutional implications

#### Evidence Analysis Framework
```
Evidence Matrix:
├── Primary Sources (Legislation, Cases, Regulations)
├── Secondary Sources (Academic commentary, Practice notes)
├── Factual Evidence (Documents, witness statements, expert reports)
└── Procedural Evidence (Court filings, orders, correspondence)
```

### Phase 3: Strategic Legal Thinking

#### Analytical Questions for Every Case
1. **What was the legal problem?**
2. **What law did the court apply?**
3. **How did the court reason through the issues?**
4. **What was the outcome and why?**
5. **What are the broader implications?**
6. **How would you argue differently?**

#### Prediction and Strategy Development
- **Outcome Prediction**: Based on precedent and facts
- **Alternative Arguments**: Different legal approaches
- **Risk Assessment**: Likelihood of success, costs, consequences
- **Client Advice**: Practical recommendations
